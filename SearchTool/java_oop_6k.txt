A company calls SoftwareFactory makes a package of digital image processing ____ that are sold to companies making ____ graphics programs (Adobe). The image processing company (SoftwareFactory) writes its classes to implement an ____, which it makes public to it's costumers. Adobe then invokes the image processing methods using the signatures and return types defined in the interface. While the SoftwareFactory's API is made public (to its customers), its implementation of the API is kept as a closely guarded secret—in fact, it may revise the implementation at a later date as long as it continues to implement the original interface that its customers have relied on. | methods, end-user, interface

#DeSerialization | is to convert a serialized representation into a replica of the original object
#Use  java.io.ObjectInputStream to deserialize an object | t
#The process of writing an object is called serialization | t
#Use  java.io.ObjectOutputStream to serialize an object |t 
#transient fields are also not serialized |t
#static fields are not written| t
#Object streams go one step beyond data streams by allowing you to read and write entire objects | t
#The low-level varieties communicate with I/O devices, and the high-level varieties communicate with low-level varieties | t
#Readers and writers are exclusively oriented to Unicode characters | t
# A low-level output stream receives bytes and writes bytes to an output device | t
#A high-level filter output stream receives general-format data, such as primitives, and writes bytes to a low-level output stream or to another filter output stream |t
#A writer is similar to a filter output stream but is specialized for writing Java strings in units of Unicode characters | t
#A low-level input stream reads bytes from an input device and returns bytes to its caller | t
# A high-level filter input stream reads bytes from a low-level input stream, or from another filter input stream, and returns general-format data to its caller | t
#A reader is similar to a filter input stream but is specialized for reading UTF strings in units of Unicode characters | t
#Low-level input streams | FileInputStream , ByteArrayInputStream
#Low-level output streams | FileOutputStream , ByteArrayOutputStream
#The most common of these extend from the superclasses FilterInputStream and FilterOutputStream | t
#Do not read/write from input/output devices such as files or sockets; rather, they read/write from other streams | t

#The RandomAccessFile class provides methods that support seeking, reading, and writing | t
#With a random-access file, you can seek to a desired position within a file and then read or write a desired amount of data |t
#Constructing an instance of File does not create a file on the local file system | t
#File class represents the name of a file or directory that might exist on the host machine’s file system |t
#UTF stands for UCS Transformation Format, and UCS in turn stands for Universal Character Set|t
#Java’s Input/Output (I/O) structure is substantially based on the concept of streams, which are classes that help you read and write files and networks |t
#A package is a grouping of related  classes, interfaces, enumerations, and annotation types providing access protection and name space management |t
#Circumstances of this type are called exception conditions in Java and are represented using objects (All exceptions descend from the java.lang.Throwable). |t
#If no exceptions are thrown in the try block, all catch blocks are bypassed |t
#If an exception arises, the first matching catch block, if any, is executed, and the rest are skipped |t
#A try block may optionally have a finally block associated with it |t
#The try block throws an exception that is not handled by any of the catch blocks  |t
#The try block executes to completion without throwing any exceptions whatsoever |t
#The try block throws an exception that is handled by one of the catch blocks |t
#Checked exception | Must be handled by either the try-catch mechanism or the throws-declaration mechanism
#Runtime exception | The right time to deal with runtime exceptions is when you’re designing, developing, and debugging your code. Since runtime exceptions should never be thrown in finished code
#All checked exception types thrown from a method must be represented in the method’s “throws” list |t
#Checked exceptions should extend java.lang.Exception or one of its subclasses |t
#Runtime exceptions should extend java.lang.RuntimeException or one of its subclasses |t
#Assertions provide a convenient mechanism for verifying that a class’s methods are called correctly. |t
#The intention is that assertions typically will be enabled during development and disabled in the field |t
#Interfaces cannot be instantiated |t
#An interface | is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types
#An inheritance |  is a relationship where objects share a common structure: the structure of one object is a sub-structure of another object. 
#If a class does not have any superclass, then it is implicitly derived from Object class |t
#Unlike other members, constructor cannot be inherited |t
#Inheritance combined with overriding facilitates polymorphism |t
